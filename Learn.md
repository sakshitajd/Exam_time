To run the project locally, you need to set up both the server and the client. Here are the steps:

**Server Setup:**

1. Navigate to the server directory:

    ```bash
    cd ExamTime/server
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command installs all the necessary dependencies for the server. It reads the `package.json` file to determine what packages are needed, and then downloads them into a `node_modules` folder.

3. Start the server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command starts the server in development mode. It looks for a script named "dev" in the `package.json` file and runs it. This usually starts up a local development server and rebuilds the app whenever you make changes.

**Client Setup:**

1. Navigate to the client directory:

    ```bash
    cd ../client
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command installs all the necessary dependencies for the client. It reads the `package.json` file to determine what packages are needed, and then downloads them into a `node_modules` folder.

3. Start the client:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command starts the client in development mode. It looks for a script named "dev" in the `package.json` file and runs it. This usually starts up a local development server and rebuilds the app whenever you make changes.

Before you start coding, create a new branch for your work. This keeps your changes separate from the main codebase and makes it easier to merge your changes later.
